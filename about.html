    <h1>Purpose of the Site</h1>
    <p>This website was created to explore the myth of Medusa and her impact on modern culture. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of her story and significance.</p>
    <h1>About the Creator</h1>
    <p>My name is Madison Roberts, and I am a Computer Science major with a minor in Art. I want to improve my skills in web development and had a really fun time doing that with this project.</p>
    <p>I chose to explore the story of Medusa for this assignment because she is the coolest looking character in Greek mythology. I was super interested to learn about what she symbolizes today.</p>
    <h1>Site Development</h1>
    <p>This site was built using HTML5 and CSS3. The project presented challenges in balancing visual appeal with user experience, but it was a valuable learning opportunity.</p>
    <h1>Citations</h1>
    <p>I used the Metropolitian Museum of Art's article, 'Medusa in Greek Art' to gather information for this website.</p>
